  <h2>The EHR</h2>

  <p>
    An electronic health record (EHR) is a digital version of a patient’s paper chart. EHRs are real-time,
    patient-centered records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users. While an
    EHR does contain the medical and treatment histories of patients, an EHR system is built to go beyond standard
    clinical data collected in a provider’s office and can be inclusive of a broader view of a patient’s care. EHRs are
    a vital part of health IT and can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Contain a patient’s medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies,
      radiology images, and laboratory and test results</li>
    <li>Allow access to evidence-based tools that providers can use to make decisions about a patient’s care</li>
    <li>Automate and streamline provider workflow</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    One of the key features of an EHR is that health information can be created and managed by authorized providers in a
    digital format capable of being shared with other providers across more than one health care organization. EHRs are
    built to share information with other health care providers and organizations – such as laboratories,
    specialists, medical imaging facilities, pharmacies, emergency facilities, and school and workplace clinics – so
    they contain information from all clinicians involved in a patient’s care.
